On approximately 131 wooded acres, the Historic District encompasses structures and landscapes designed by four generations of the Bohlen architectural dynasty begun in 1853 by Diedrich Bohlen. Architecturally trained in Germany, Bohlen later settled in Indianapolis, working briefly with noted architect Francis Costigan. In an overall Beaux Arts design, structures in the Historic District span from 1844 to 1969 and are primarily representative of Classical Revival, Italianate and Moderne architectural styles. Carved limestone, leaded glass, cast plaster, marble and metal embellishments add a rich texture to the landmark buildings, illustrating the character and craftsmanship that poured into over a century of design.
