    Designed primarily by D.A. Bohlen and Son, the campus of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods (SMW) Historic District is an outstanding representation of four generations of work by Indiana’s oldest and longest-existing architectural firm. Noted architectural historian Dr. James Glass will present on Bohlen design across Indiana and at SMW, many of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The presentation will feature historic illustrations, Bohlen correspondences, and photos of landmarks such as the Morris-Butler House and Murat Temple in Indianapolis, French Lick Springs Hotel, and Shelby County Courthouse, along with examples from the recently listed SMW Historic District.

    Jointly presented by Sisters of Providence and Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College, this program is made possible through a Historic Preservation Education Grant from Indiana Landmarks, Indiana Humanities, and the National Endowment for the Humanities; with additional support by the Terre Haute Convention and Visitors Bureau.
