    From 1853 to 1968, four generations of the Bohlen family of Indianapolis designed exceptional buildings across Indiana. On October 3, architectural historian Dr. James Glass will present insights into examples of Bohlen architecture that include French Lick Springs Hotel, Shelby County Courthouse, and the Murat Temple in Indianapolis. D.A. Bohlen and Son also designed Indiana Landmarks’ Morris-Butler House, Crown Hill’s Gothic Chapel and most of the buildings for the Sisters of Providence and Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College near Terre Haute. The presentation will feature historic illustrations and photos of landmarks still-in-use and others lost, including the English Opera House and Hotel on Monument Circle.

    Jointly presented by Sisters of Providence and Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College, this program is made possible through a Historic Preservation Education Grant from Indiana Landmarks, Indiana Humanities, and the National Endowment for the Humanities; with additional support by the Terre Haute Convention and Visitors Bureau.
