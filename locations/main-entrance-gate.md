The Main Gate marked the perimeter of an expanded campus and today establishes a Classical sense of procession through Saint Mary-of-the-Woods Historic District. The campus architecture and landscape draw from Greek and Roman design that was prominent in the late 19th to mid-20th centuries. The brick, concrete and limestone gateway was designed by D.A. Bohlen and Son and constructed by M.J. Hoffman Construction Company. The iron gates are 17 feet tall and weigh over two tons each.
