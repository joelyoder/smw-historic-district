Flagstone walks lead to a religious shrine along the west side of The Avenue, nearly opposite of Le Fer Hall. A semi-circular limestone ashlar wall steps up toward the center like the apse of a cathedral, framing stone figures of Saint Mary, two kneeling nuns, and a kneeling shepherd boy with sheep. A similarly constructed low wall is in front, with a kneeling bench centered in it. A bronze plaque on one end of the apse wall indicates this is a 1954 memorial from SMWC Alumnae and Sisters of Providence to Mother Marie Helene Franey, the ninth General Superior and College President.
