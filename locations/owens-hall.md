The first building to break from traditional revival styles of the campus, Owens Hall reflects the massing and rejection or ornamentation of modern architecture being introduced from Europe at the time. Its horizontal expanse of brick and stone is interrupted linear divisions and vertical bays covered in stone. Its symmetry, implied porticos and abstracted classical details connect it to earlier architecture of the District. The chapel wing off the back of the building has pilasters with Art Deco-inspired capitals extending above the parapet and a stylized stone cross with a large window centered in it. The interior features a modern lobby in marble and aluminum.
