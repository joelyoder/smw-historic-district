A concrete filled-spandrel arch pedestrian bridge off Grotto Lane links a walkway between Hulman and Le Fer Halls with a pathway that leads to the Sisters of Providence motherhouse north of the grotto. The bridge has one wide arch and partial arches that terminate on each side into the earthen embankment. The arches have recessed panels and the balustrade of the bridge is composed of full-round arched panels. Pairs of concrete piers with recessed panels have lights terminating the balustrade at the ends of the bridge and planters between.
