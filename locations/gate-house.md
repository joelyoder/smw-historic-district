Tiny by comparison to other buildings in the District, the Gate House was overbuilt of materials that complement and tie to the larger buildings on campus. The building has a gable-on-hip roof with a stone sill, brown brick walls and stone trim.  It housed a “guard” into the 1990s, when the gate was no longer locked at night. The Gate House now serves as an information center on the trailhead for campus and community trails.
