The two story Guest House was originally built as the Faculty Residence. It is unpretentiously built of random-coursed sandstone ashlar with smooth limestone trim, topped by a hipped roof with slate tiles. The projecting gabled entry porch introduces elements of other architectural periods represented in the District, with Doric square columns and aluminum doors with full windows, side-lights and transom.
