Currently a private residence, the chaplain’s house was built in the style of a French manor house and incorporates bricks from the original priest’s house built in 1840. The west façade features a six-sided, two-story tower with segmental-arched window and a porch with a balcony and stone balustrade. The current porches were an early 20th century renovation, when the main entrance was moved from the south side of the building to face The Avenue.
