To fulfill a promise when peace was declared during World War I, a grotto was built into the south hillside of a ravine between Grotto Road and Hulman Hall. Composed of rough-laid grey stone, some brought by the Sisters from Lourdes, France. Two wide, cavern-like openings at the ground level support a narrow opening with a statue of Saint Mary. The larger openings contain a kneeling bench and granite altar. Our Lady of Lourdes Grotto was built into a ravine in 1918 near the middle of the campusâ€™s east side.
