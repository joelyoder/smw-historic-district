The current fountain replaced a black iron fountain and provides an exclamation point for The Avenue. The concrete fountain has a quatre-foil bottom basin with four piers in its center that support an upper round basin. A compound pier in the center of the upper basin forms the support for a top basin that features the fountain spray.
