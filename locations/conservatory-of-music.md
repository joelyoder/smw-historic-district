Said to be patterned after Leipzig Opera House (destroyed in WW II, 1943), the Conservatory of Music beautifully speaks to Classical symmetry, procession and ornamentation. The limestone and brick exterior is divided into three sections. The portico-like center bay is accented by wide steps flanked by sidewalls and period lights. Three entry doors with arched transoms are tucked under a second floor balcony and stone balustrade supported by massive scrolled brackets that support two-story stone Ionic columns leading the eye upward to the entablature and stepped parapet. Inside, the foyer features terrazzo floor with inlaid mosaics, marble wainscot and coffered ceilings. Grand staircases of marble, ornate metal and wood balustrades and marble wainscot flank three pairs of wood doors leading to the 725-seat auditorium. Carved angels look out from the tympanum above each door. Inside the auditorium is a cantilevered balcony and leaded glass dome contribute to near-perfect acoustics.
