Built as an inn for visitors, Woodland Inn was outside the original gates of campus. Currently a private residence, its asymmetrical design allows flexible room arrangement and picturesque external silhouettes. It is dark red brick accented by brick belt courses edged with raised stretcher brick between each story and a rusticated stone belt course at the top of the walls. West (front) and north elevations feature rounded porches, towers and turrets. Pre-Classical elements of Tuscan columns, Grecian urn balustrade and acanthus leaves decorate the exterior.
