The stable consist of the original 1925 south-facing building and a north addition (2002) that enclose a courtyard. The historic building has a gambrel roof and cross gable roof wings at east and west ends of the front and back facades, creating an I-plan. Walls are dark brown glazed block with buff-colored brick trim around windows and doors. Windows have stone sills. Block walls terminating in brick pillars create a narrow courtyard at the south entrance. Both the original and the board and batten sided, gable roofed addition are shingled in red asphalt.
