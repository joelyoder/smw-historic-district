A cast metal statue of Christ in a pavilion-like structure is located near the east edge of the district north of the Way of the Cross.  It terminates a linear concrete path leading from Owens Hall to the east. The statue has a stone base and is under a round-roofed metal pavilion with cast metal columns.
