Northeast of the fountain that terminates the axis of the Avenue is a stone statue of Saint Mary, mounted on a monumental fluted Corinthian stone column on a tall, tapered stone base. The base is engraved with rows of dentils and words commemorating Saint Mary. Base and column were designed by D.A. Bohlen and Son.
