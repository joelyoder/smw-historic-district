A serpentine concrete path leads from the cemetery to the Sisters of Providence motherhouse. The path, known as the Outdoor Way of the Cross, features the fourteen Stations of the Cross depicting Jesus Christ on the day of His crucifixion. Each station is composed of a limestone base with engraved description and expertly crafted bronze sculptures depicting each event. Each station is staggered, flanking the path.
